Installing GFW-Simulator on DLink DIR-505 -- From Scratch
===========================

## Introduction

This tutorial describes how to install GFW-Simulator from a stock DLink
DIR-505 router, with no custom firmware or whatsoever.

Roughly saying there are these two steps:

+ Install OpenWRT
+ Install GFW-Sim

## Instructions: Installing OpenWRT

### (Chinese version only) Flashing a stock international firmware

If you purchased a DIR-505 from within China, chances are that the
router is restricted to regional firmware (Chinese only). To confirm
if your router is the Chinese version, compare the electric plug.

If you are already on an International version, skip this part.

1. Download the file from `ftp://files.dlink.com.au/products/DIR-505/REV_A/Firmware/v1.09b02/DIR-505A1_FW109B02.bin`.

2. Instrument the firmware file using WinHex or Bless/GHex2.

At offset `0x3e`, change `DEF` to `CN\0`.

Alternatively, you can also just download an instrumented version from [here](https://software-download.name/download/opensource/DIR505A1_FW109B02.bin).

3. Connect your PC to the router.

+ You can use a cable to connect it to your PC.
+ Or you can also connect it with the WiFi AP and password (The default
password should be printed on the router). Wireless connectivity is not
recommended for flashing firmware but it almost always works.

4. Navigate to `http://192.168.0.1` (default IP). Login. Click on `Maintenance`
then `Firmware`.

5. Upload the instrumented firmware.

### Flashing OpenWRT.

Download from `http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-dir-505-a1-squashfs-factory.bin` the latest OpenWRT firmware.

Again, log in via `http://192.168.0.1` or whatever IP you use.
`Maintenance` then `Firmware`. Upload the firmware above.

### Installing GFW.

Connect your PC to the router.

You may need to setup SSH service if it's the first time you boot from
OpenWRT. Do a

      telnet 192.168.1.1
      >passwd

Or whatever IP you happen to use. Configure the password as prompted.

Now you can SSH to the router via `ssh root@192.168.1.1`.

      scp gfw.ipk root@192.168.1.1:/tmp
      ssh root@192.168.1.1
      opkg update
      opkg install /tmp/gfw.ipk

### (Alternative, easier) Use prebuilt binary image

After you do a `passwd` on the router, do the following instead

      # On your PC.
      cd ~
      wget https://github.com/phoeagon/gfw-sim/releases/download/alpha-v0.0/conf_uploaded.bin -O 1.bin
      scp 1.bin root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/backup.bin
      ssh root@192.168.1.1
      > # on router via ssh
      > sysupgrade -n -v /tmp/backup.bin
      > # now wait till the router reboots.

The prebuilt images has the following passwords:

    System: root gfw-protected
    Wifi (WPA2): GFWed gfw-protected
